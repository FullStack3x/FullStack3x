- ☁️ Aspiring Cloud Practitioner 
- 🌱 I started off studying HTML, CSS and Javascript, eventually getting into GRC taking an ISSO class and going from there. I'm now building my technical knowledge from the ground up, working on building servers and understanding the architecture of a computer from the hardware and software basics, to building a secure linux distro. I'm also working on understanding how to build/maintain a secure security program From GRC Analyst to CISO (Potentially). I love tech, studying all of this is fun, and if it can bring my family a better life as well as contribute something positive to the world, I know I'm doing the right thing.
